Under construction...

SSA-for-MAX-CUT is an implementation of the Simulated Simultaneous Annealing algorithm for solving the MAX-CUT problem. The MAX-CUT problem is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization. This repository contains an implementation of the Stochastic Simulated Annealing (SSA) algorithm to tackle the MAX-CUT problem as described in the research paper ["Fast-Converging Simulated Annealing for Ising Models Based on Integral Stochastic Computing"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9743572).ã€€In addition, it contains an extented algorithm SSAI (SSA with individual noise) with the hyperparameter determintion in the research paper ["Local Energy Distribution Based Hyperparameter Determination for Stochastic Simulated Annealing"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11839).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nonizawa/SSA-for-MAX-CUT.git
cd SSA-for-MAX-CUT
```

## Single Run

### SSA

To run the SSA algorithm on a single instance, use the sa.py script. For example:

```sh
python ssa.py --file_path graph/G1.txt --cylce 1000 --trial 100 --tau 1 --param 1
```
You can find the simulation results in ./result/.

Here ia the options.

--file_path: a graph file

--cycle: Number of cycles for 1 trial

--trial: Number of trials to evaluate the performance on average

--tau:  A pseudo inverse temperature is increased every tau cycle

--param: There are eight parameters written in ssa.py


### SSAI

Here is a python program for SSAI that can run, like SSA.
- ssai.py

It has the same options as well as SSA.


### SA

Also, here is a python program for traditional SA.
- sa.py

Here is the options.

--file-path: a graph file

--cycle: Number of cycles for 1 trial

--trial: Number of trials to evaluate the performance on average

--T_ini  Initial temperature

--T_min: Minimum temperature (last temperature)

## Batch Processing

### SSA

To run the SSA algorithm on multiple graphs in a batch, use the batch_sa.sh script. For example:

```sh
./batch_ssa.sh
```
Before running, please modify line 17 to specify your Python path.

### SSAI

Here is a python program for SSAI.
- batch_ssai.sh

### SA

Also, here is a python program for traditional SA.
- batch_sa.sh
